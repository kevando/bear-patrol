# bear-patrol

## Run Locally

```
git clone https://github.com/kevando/bear-patrol.git
cd bear-patrol
npm install
node start
```

This runs both client and server

Client = [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)

Server = [http://127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081)

In order to connect to the database you will need the super secret fb.json file and you get get that from kevando.


If for some reason `npm install` fails, try `yarn install`
